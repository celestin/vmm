This example illustrates how to create a passive transactor response
model, as described in section titled

                     "Passive Response"

in Chapter 4, on p182 of the 1st edition of the VMM book.

It uses a simply producer/consumer transactor pair. In a monitoring or
response stack, the flow of execution would go away from the DUT.
