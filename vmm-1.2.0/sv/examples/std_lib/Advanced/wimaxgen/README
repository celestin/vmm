test1.sv demonstrates how to use vmm_opts through command-line or option file (see the Makefile for +vmm_opts+ commands). In phy_tb_config, the rand variable num_of_dl_pusc_subchannels is set with vmm_opts, while num_of_ul_subchannels is left constrained random.

test2.sv extends the phy_frame transaction class with new constraints and shows how to replace all phy_frame factories in a single line.

The two vmm_tests are run sequentially in a single vmm_simulation.
The vmm_opt configuration applies to both tests, while num_of_ul_subchannels is indeed randomized twice.
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
