To be able to succesfully compile the SystemVerilog code in this
distribution using VCS2009.06, some conditional code might have been
included to work around some limitations in the SystemVerilog
constructs supported by this version of VCS. The directives and
release notes mentionned in this document are not necessary if you are
using a later release of VCS.


You *MUST* define the symbol `VCS2009_06 when compiling the
SystemVerilog source code. This can be accomplished from the command
line using the +define option as shown below:

  % vcs -sverilog +define+VCS2009_06 +incdir=$VMM_HOME/sv ...


There are no user-visible limitations.
