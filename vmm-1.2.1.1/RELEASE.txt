Topic: Overview

The VMM methodology defines industry best practices for creating
robust, reusable and scalable verification environments using
SystemVerilog. 

Introduced in 2005, VMM is the industry s most widely
used and proven verification methodology for SystemVerilog. 

The VMM methodology enables verification novices and experts alike to develop: 
 - Powerful transaction-level
 - Constrained-random verification environments. 
 - Reusable verification environments across projects
 - Reusable verification environments from block-level to SoC

A comprehensive set of guidelines, recommendations and
rules help engineers avoid common mistakes while creating
interoperable verification components. The VMM Standard Library
provides the foundation base classes for building advanced
testbenches, while VMM Applications provide higher-level functions for
improved productivity.

to obtain VMM-related support. In addition, VMM Central offers the
latest VMM-related news and a broad array of useful resources.

Topic: VMM 1.2.0 Release Notes

VMM 1.2 adds new classes and concepts to provide additional functionality and flexibility:
  - Parameterization support to many existing classes including channels and 
    generators
  - TLM-2.0 support, which adds remote procedure call functionality between 
    components and extends support to SystemC modules. 
  - Hierarchical Configuration Options adds a rich set of methods for controlling 
    testbench functionality from the runtime command line, configuration files or 
    from within the testench code itself. 
  - Class Factory API allows for easier replacement of the class factory 
    instances compared to the earlier versions of VMM. 
  - Common Base Class provides hierarchical naming in multiple namespaces 
    along with enhanced object search functionality.
  - Concept of implicit phasing and hierarchical timelines for enhanced 
    flexibility and reuse of verification components. Implicit phasing 
    enables components to control their own simlation progress. Hierarchical 
    phasing promotes block-to-system reuse, set-up, and restart of power domains.

VMM 1.2 is based on the feedback and contributions of many
verification engineers who participate in the verification community
discussion forums at VMM Central.
