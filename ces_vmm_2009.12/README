Last Update: 2010-03-11
======================================================================


These Instructions are intended to help you with the installation of 
the tools needed to successfully run the labs, and with the installation 
of the lab database itself.

CONTENTS
================================

1. Software installation
2. Lab database installation
3. Lab database configuration and testing


**********************************************************************
1. Software installation
======================================================================

This workshop needs the following tool(s) to be installed:

- VCS  V-2009.12


To download the required software release, you have to access
the Solvnet Release Library:

1. Navigate your browser to http://solvnet.synopsys.com

2. Log in using your solvnet id and password
   If you are not registered, follow the directions on this 
   page to sign up for solvnet

3. Select "Release Library" under the heading "Software and Installation"

4. Use the drop-down menus to select the correct software

5. Follow the instructions to download and install the software on 
   your workstation


**********************************************************************
2. Lab database Installation
======================================================================

1. FTP "get" the file  ces_vmm_2009.12.tar.gz

2. Execute the following commands to unpack the archive:

        unix$  gzip -dc ces_vmm_2009.12.tar.gz | tar xf -

   Or if you are using gtar:

        unix$  gtar xzf ces_vmm_2009.12.tar.gz


Multiple account installation:
Since the lab directory structure may contain symbolic links that 
should be preserved instead of being expanded, it is strongly 
recommended that you untar the file directly into each account.
Repeat the following for every user account:

unix$ cd /path/to/user/account1
unix$ gzip -dc /path/to/ces_vmm_2009.12.tar.gz | tar xf -


**********************************************************************
3. Lab database configuration and testing
======================================================================


Configuration
==============================

The "setup.csh" file is provided for your convenience.
Please modify it appropriately to match your local environment. 
source the modified setup.csh file prior to testing and 
running the labs.


Testing
==============================

To verify the functionality of the lab files, it is recommended that
you run the supplied test script (the current directory must be
the "ces_vmm_2009.12" directory):


        unix$  ./.testscript


This will run a series of tests to verify that all files exist, and that
the tool can be invoked.

If everything is ok, you should see output similar to:

 Skipping Test 5 - GUI (dve)

 Installation Test PASSED for VMM Course


------------------------------------------------------------

Note:
By default, the GUI (dve) test is skipped.
To include the GUI test, edit the file ".testscript" and change the
variable $test_vcs_gui "1" at the top of the file. 
Rerun the test after that.
Make sure that you have the DISPLAY environment variable set
correctly, otherwise the test will fail.
